        <p class = concept>CONCEPT: A button that allows you to watch a touchdown scored by a player on your ESPN fantasy team.</p>
        <div class = descriptions> 
            <p>
                TRIGGER: A “Touchdown!” pop-up tab appears at bottom of screen when a player on your 
                team scores a touchdown.  A few seconds later, the “Touchdown!” tab will reveal a 
                “watch” button to see a replay of the touchdown.  This micro-interaction is initiated by the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                RULES: Once the user taps on the “watch” button, the instant replay of the touchdown is showed on the
                 screen.  Users can exit out of this action by hitting an “X” button.  If the user chooses not to press 
                 “watch” after it appears on the “Touchdown!” Tab, then the tab will disappear after a few seconds.  
                 Alternatively, it can be swiped down and away by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                FEEDBACK: Once the “watch” button is pressed, the user will see and hear a replay of the touchdown, and
                the background will be greyed out to signify that the replay has initiated and is active. 
            </p>
            <p>
                LOOPS & MODES: The “watch” button and “Touchdown!” tab will appear every time a touchdown is scored by a 
                player on the user&apos;s team.  If another player on the team scores a touchdown while the current “Touchdown!” 
                tab is open, then it will be next in line after the current touchdown sequence is being played out.
