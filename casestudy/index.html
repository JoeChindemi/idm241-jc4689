    <h1>The Overview</h1>
        <p>For my IDM 241 course, I had to recreate and implement micro-interactions into an existing website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I had to think creatively to come up with useful solutions and improvements to current programs, and had to produce a fully-functional micro-interaction at the end of the course.  Through 11 weeks, I researched, conceptualized, tested, and built a micro-interaction that expands upon NBA.coms sign-in model with GIF and signifiers.</p>
        <h1>Context and Challenge</h1>
        <p>In this course, IDM 241, we focused on micro-interactions and how to build them using scripting techniques.  The main problem that I needed to solve was giving a component of a site that had few/no micro-interactions unique micro-interactions.  This project exists to help its participants understand the concepts behind micro-interactions, and how they can be applied in code.  It also shows what it takes to actually plan ideas out and construct them based on trial and error.  I had the full quarter (about 11 weeks not including breaks) to build my project.</p>
        <p>The final goal of this project was to implement multiple unique micro-interactions to an existing component of a website.  This was a solo project, and In order to complete this final goal, I had to figure out a series of smaller problems.  First, I had to recreate a micro-interaction on a certain component of a website.  Then, I had to figure out how I could add multiple, unique micro-interactions to this component and be able to define its triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes.  I really had to think about what micro-interactions I could implement to the program I chose, and how they could improve the program and still seamlessly integrate with the themes of the site itself.</p>
        <h1>Process and Insight</h1>
        <p>I started off by trying to select a website to build my project upon, and building my initial micro-interaction.  Since it was football, I thought about doing the ESPN Fantasy app.  I have been playing fantasy football for a few years now, and I thought that it would be a cool idea to create a micro-interaction that displayed a green “touchdown” overlay pop-up when a player on your team scored a touchdown.  I ran into several problems when trying to create this concept for my initial micro-interaction.  Firstly, there were issues with the site itself.  You can only see this micro-interaction happen if you have an ESPN fantasy account, have a team, are part of a league, and are actively playing in a game that only happens a few times per week.  Thats a lot of hurdles to go through just to access the micro-interaction.  Secondly, you would only be able to see this micro-interaction if you were on the scorers table screen for a long period of time.  The scorers table screen is where you see your fantasy players and their points they actively learn from you during a game.  Since a player is not on the field at all times, it can take minutes for them to show back up and score points.  Not many people are sitting around waiting for a player to score.  Finally, this micro-interaction already exists!  As I was researching the ESPN fantasy app, I asked my friends that I am in the same fantasy league with if they ever noticed any micro-interactions that occur during touchdowns.  Apparently, they do!  A players name and picture icon will light up green to signify when they score a touchdown, similar to what I had planned.  Before I could realize this, I was misunderstanding our assignment.  In the beginning stages, we were actually meant to replicate an existing micro-interaction of a program, not to create a brand new micro-interaction just yet.  By the time I figured this out, I had already decided to switch topics.  Overall, I think it was for the best.  The idea I already had was way too complicated, and I had no idea how I could expand upon that further.</p>

        <p>The NBA.com sign in page, however, did seem like something more feesbile.  The NBA season was starting up, and one day I logged into NBA.com to get up to date and read some articles.  I noticed that the sign-in page was boring.  I felt as if I could replicate the basic micro-interactions, such as hovering on and off the sign-in button, but there was a lot of potential to implement micro-interactions unique to the identity of the NBA that would improve the sign-in model.</p>
        <img src="./images/SL_originial.png" alt="Original interface"></img>
        <p>I started off by replicating the NBA.com sign-in interface as best I could.  I matched the model design wise, excluding the input boxes.  I also replicated the hover-on and hover-off button, but I took an unnecessary step in creating a loading pop-up after the button was clicked.  In later iterations, I discarded this.  I wanted to focus more on the sign-in module itself rather than outside factors.</p>

        <img src="./images/SL_replicaOn.png" alt="Replica on"></img>
        <p>After this, I came up with a great idea for improvement.  I shrunk the sign-in module, and added an empty div to the side of the module.  When the sign-in button got clicked, the empty div to the left displayed a looping GIF of a basketball being scored and said “SUCCESS!”.  I think this was a useful micro-interaction to add because it added a good visual signifier to being signed in successfully, and added fun to the standard sign in process.</p>

        <img src="./images/beta_on.png" alt="Beta on"></img>
        <p>For the rest of my project, I decided to expand upon this concept.  I created input boxes so users could actually input information to the sign-in.  Then, using Javascript, I coded a series of if statements that would determine reactions to sign-in information.  These reactions would then influence the final build and trigger certain micro-interactions based on the sign-in status.
        </p>
        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <p>For this project, I re-created the NBA.com sign in model.  However, I added key microinteractions to the sign-in process.</p>
        <img src="./images/SL_finalInit.png" alt="Final initial prototype"></img>
        <p>If the input boxes of the sign-in were blank, then a GIF of a ref would appear at the top right of the sign-in box, calling a timeout.  The input text would also turn red, and this now signified that the input boxes were left empty.</p>
        <img src="./images/SL_input.png" alt="Final input"></img>
        <p>If the input boxes were filled and the sign-in button got pressed, then the incorrect GIF disappeared.  However, if the information was incorrect, then a GIF of a basketball clanking off a rim and text that says “UNSUCCESSFUL… TRY AGAIN” will appear.  The input text stays red, and this now signifies that the sign-in was unsuccessful.</p>
        <img src="./images/SL_fail.png" alt="Final fail"></img>
        <p>Now, if the correct information is input and the sign-in button is clicked, then the input text turns green and the made basket GIF displays with text that says “SIGN IN SUCCESSFUL!”</p>

        <h1>The Results</h1>
        <p>I think this project was a success.  The hardest part for me was trying to find a program that I could implement micro-interactions into.  It felt like so many programs already had so many useful micro-interactions, but this project really challenged me to think creatively and find ways to include and create useful concepts.  The project as a whole was really fun, and I learned a lot along the way.  I had previously learned about micro-interactions in other courses, but Ive never had the chance to conceptualize, build, and code them.  For something so small, it really is time consuming and can require a lot of thought.  Overall, I think I executed the idea of the project well, and Im happy with the results.  I really think I improved the NBA.com sign in model. </p>
